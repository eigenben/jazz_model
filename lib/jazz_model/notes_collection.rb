module JazzModel
  # NotesCollection represents a collection of notes.  Using this collection,
  # you can determine chord and scale/mode matches in specific or all keys.
  # This class is currently under heavily development and will eventually be home to heavy logic involved
  # in associating an arbitrary collection of notes with chords, given that
  # some scales tone may be "omitable", etc.
  #
  # == Creating a NotesCollection object
  #
  # Creating the collection of notes should be done by indexing
  # the Notes class directly with a comma-separated string of notes.
  #
  # == Current Limitations
  #
  # Will only do exact 100% match of notes given and notes in chords.  No fuzzyness
  # such as the ability to omit the root and other non-important tones.  Does not yet
  # find supersets or subsets.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  # === Finding All Associated Chords
  #
  #   NotesCollection['C, E, G, A'].chords.symbols
  #   # => "Amin7, Cmaj6"
  #
  # === Finding Associated Chords in Given Key
  #
  #   NotesCollection['C, E, G, A'].in_key_of('A').chords.symbols
  #   # => "Amin7"
  #
