  # A standard chord symbol (if there is such a thing...).
  # Several chord symbols can be associated with a given chord,
  # and each chord can be designated +case_sensitive+ or not, to handle
  # cases such as M representing Major and m representing minor.
  # Act as a list to facilitate preference ordering.  May abandong this
  # in the future to prefer a simple +primary+ designation.
  #
  # == Associations
  #
  # * +chord+ - Chord associated with the chord symbol.
