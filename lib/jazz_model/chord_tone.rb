module JazzModel
  # Represents one non-octval tone in a chord.  Chord tones are not ordered
  # and arrays of chord tones should be compared using +to_set+.
  #
  # == Attributes
  #
  # * +tone+ - A tone index from 0-11 representing the relative position of the
  #   tone within the chromatic scale.
  #
  # * +letter_index+ - A 0-6 value representing the relative letter position, which
  #   helps to disambiguate theoretic values such as Eb and D#.  See +Key+.
  #
  # * +strength+ - A strength metric representing the tonal strength of the tone
  #   within the context of the chord.  Lower numbers are stronger.  Zero always
  #   represents the root of the chord and any guide tones should be defined as one.
  #
  # * +omitable+ - Specifies whether the tone can commonly be ommitted in jazz voicings
  #   for this chord.  For example, the root and the fifth are often not necessary.
  #
  # == Key Context
  #
  #  +key+ is delgated to chord to access the chord's key context.
