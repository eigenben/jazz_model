module JazzModel
  # In music theory a mode is essentially a slice of a scale with an offset. 
  # For example second mode of the C major scale would begin and end on D 
  # but otherwise have the exact same tones as the C major scale.
  # 
  # This class represents a mode within the context of a +Scale+.  
  # 
  # == Associations
  # 
  # * +scale+ - The related scale.
  # * +chord_scales+ - +ChordScale+ relationships to this mode.
  # * +chords+ - Direct access to a collection of chords through +chord_scales+.
  # 
  # == Tones and Mode Context
  # 
  # Tones are directly related to scales, not modes.  There is a +tones+ method 
  # (and a +notes+ method that delegates to +tones+) here that simulates the tones for 
  # the mode by setting the mode context of the scale tones, effectively returning 
  # the tones shifted by X where X is the mode number.
  # Therefore, you can access tones directly off of the mode because they are proxied 
  # through scale with the correct offset. 
  # 
  # == Examples
  # 
  # Since modes should be accessed within the context of scales, mode-related examples are 
  # actually in scale.  See +Scale+.
