  # A key represents a specific theoretic tone mapped to a pitch and a letter 
  # index.  Keys are defined for all letters A-G and all sharp/flat values 
  # within two semitons (e.g. Dbb, D Double-Flat enharmonic with C).
  #
  # Each key is associated an index between 0-11 to represent the actual pitch 
  # within the chromatic scale.  
  # Each key is also assigned a "letter index" which represents a relative letter 
  # value.  This index is crucial as it disambiguates theoretical tone differences 
  # such as Eb and D#.  Doing so also supports correct double-sharp and double-flat 
  # interpretations which are rare but theoretically different from their enharmonic 
  # counterparts.
